# Node Skeleton Frontend
This repo contains a skeleton Companies House NodeJS frontend project.

## Technologies

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
- [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)
- [NunJucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks)
- [GulpJS](https://gulpjs.com/)
- [Inversify](https://github.com/inversify/)

## Recommendations

We recommend the use of Visual Studio Code for development as it allows the installation of the TSLint and the Nunjucks plugins. These plugins will make linting of TS and Nunjuck much better than mmost code editors.

IntelliJ does not have a Nunjuck plugin
